### About Me


ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to my GitHub journey!

I'm Prachi, Master of Economics student at NUS, hailing from a rich quantitative background fostered during my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at the esteemed University of Delhi. With a fervent passion for mathematical and econometric modeling, I find immense joy in translating theoretical concepts into practical solutions through the power of Python.

My proficiency extends across a diverse array of programming languages and software tools, including Python, R, STATA, SQL, and MATLAB. This proficiency has been further honed through immersive experiences, including conducting impactful econometric analyses at the esteemed Indian Ministry of Finance, where I leveraged tools such as EViews and Microfit to uncover valuable insights.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I have embarked on a journey of exploration through a myriad of projects spanning from novice to advanced levels. Each project serves as a canvas for creativity and innovation, allowing me to delve deeper into the intricate intersections of mathematics, economics, and technology.

Beyond the realms of academia and coding, I am an enthusiastic explorer, constantly seeking new experiences and connections. I thrive on collaboration and cherish the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals who share my zeal for pushing the boundaries of knowledge and discovery.

Currently, I am captivated by the dynamic field of behavioral economics, where I am actively exploring innovative ways to apply behavioral insights using Python. If you're passionate about mathematical modeling, econometrics, or behavioral economics, or simply wish to connect and collaborate, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub or via email at indiraprachi90@outlook.com. Let's embark on an inspiring journey of discovery together!
